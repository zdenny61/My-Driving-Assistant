# My-Driving-Assistant
Road Side Assistant Application

My Driving Assistant is a easy to use all in one application that makes it easy to access features related to your car
and driving experience. The app allows you to store important documents, have list of emergence contacts, and show location
of nearest car services around you. The interface is easy to use and you get the benefit of it all being in one app.
Documents are stored local on device for safety and using Touch/Face ID to access them. You also will get notified when
your important documents are about to expire. My Driving Assistant can help you when you need a quick car fix as well
with instruction for how to change a tire, jump start a car, and many more that will be added with each update.

I am providing this code to people so you can use it to learn about the features that im using and how they are used.
Feel free to learn and use the code as stated in the licence agreement. Hope it can solve anything your trying to figure
out! Also if you would like to participate in my project, let me know. I am currently tackling the current memory leak issue.
